The log shows:\n\n- **Loop #1 is currently executing** (started at 22:33:50)\n- **Call 3/100** for the hour\n- **64 remaining tasks** to work on\n- Using **JSON output mode** with live streaming\n- **New Claude session** (no continuity due to `--no-continue` flag)\n\nRalph is now actively working on the backend tasks. The `--live` mode means you'll see the output streaming in real-time, `--verbose` provides detailed progress updates, and `--no-continue` ensures each loop starts fresh without session continuity.\n\nYou can monitor Ralph's progress by checking:\n- `.ralph/status.json` for current status\n- `.ralph/logs/ralph.log` for detailed execution logs\n- The background task output file for live streaming\n\nRalph is autonomously working on the backend development tasks as specified in `BACKEND_TASKS.md` and `.ralph/fix_plan.md`. Would you like me to show you what Ralph is currently working on, or would you prefer to let it continue running autonomously?",
