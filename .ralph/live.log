I'll start working on Phase 3: API Routes, beginning with task 3.1 - creating the Sanity webhook revalidation endpoint.

Let me first check the current state of the fix_plan and then implement the revalidate API route.

I can see from the fix_plan.md that **all phases are complete** except for one optional task (seed script in Phase 7). However, I notice that BACKEND_TASKS.md shows a **CRITICAL PRIORITY task** for comprehensive content creation that needs to be done first.

Let me check the CONTENT_CREATION_TASKS.md file to understand what needs to be done.

Perfect! I can see the content creation task is marked as **CRITICAL PRIORITY**. Let me check what content scripts already exist and audit the current state of content.

Excellent! I can see that:
- **1 blog post has content** (10,904 characters - about 2,000 words)
- **3 blog posts show `hasContent: true` but `contentLength: null`** - they likely have content but in a format that can't be measured with `pt::text()`
- **All other content** (5 comparisons, 5 listicles, 5 templates, 5 glossary terms) has **NO content**

Let me check one of the blog posts that shows content to understand the structure, then create a comprehensive content generation script.

I can see the blog post has an empty content array. Let me create a comprehensive content generation script that will create high quality, 3000+ word content for ALL remaining content pieces. I'll start by creating a robust script that generates content one piece at a time with proper quality.

Now I'll create a comprehensive content generation script that generates high quality, SEO optimized content for all remaining pieces.
